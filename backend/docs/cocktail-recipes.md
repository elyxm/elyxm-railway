# Cocktail Recipe Management System - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive **multi-tenant** cocktail recipe management system inspired by Difford's Guide. The system supports complex filtering, ingredient management, user interactions, recipe importing capabilities, and sophisticated role-based access control (RBAC) across multiple clients.

## System Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Hybrid 3-Tier Design

1. **Tier 1: Core Recipe Data** - Direct database columns for performance-critical fields
2. **Tier 2: Structured Relationships** - Normalized tables for ingredients, user interactions, and multi-tenancy
3. **Tier 3: Flexible Metadata** - Generic system for tags, classifications, and extensible attributes

### Multi-Tenancy Features

- **Client Management**: Platform team manages clients and their restaurants
- **User Roles & Permissions**: Sophisticated RBAC with platform-managed roles
- **Recipe Ownership**: Platform recipes (public/restricted) + Client recipes (restaurant-scoped)
- **Ingredient Management**: Platform ingredients + Client-specific ingredients
- **Access Controls**: Feature/functionality access based on user roles

### Key Features

- Advanced filtering system (9 category types)
- Multi-tenant ingredient management with ownership
- User ratings and personal lists per client context
- Recipe import from external sources
- Role-based feature access control
- Client invitation and user management system
- DataTable UI (leveraging existing patterns)

## AI Code Assistant Context

### Project Status

- **Base System**: MedusaJS 2.0 e-commerce platform
- **Existing Modules**: Restaurant management, delivery system
- **UI Pattern**: DataTable components with professional admin interface
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with MikroORM
- **Admin SDK**: @medusajs/admin-sdk with custom routes and components
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Shared database with sophisticated access controls

### Current Codebase Patterns

```
backend/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ restaurant/     # Reference implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ delivery/       # Reference implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cocktail/       # NEW MODULE (to be built)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client/         # NEW MODULE (multi-tenancy)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rbac/           # NEW MODULE (role-based access control)
â”œâ”€â”€ admin/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/         # Custom admin pages (platform & client contexts)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hooks/          # Data fetching hooks with tenant awareness
â””â”€â”€ api/
    â””â”€â”€ admin/          # API endpoints with access control
```

### Established Patterns

- **DataTable**: Uses @medusajs/ui with built-in search, filtering, sorting, pagination
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints with query parameter support
- **Admin Routes**: React components with defineRouteConfig
- **Data Fetching**: Custom hooks with debounced search and optimistic updates

### Multi-Tenancy Patterns (To Be Established)

- **Tenant Context**: Client-aware data access and UI rendering
- **RBAC Integration**: Role-based feature visibility and access control
- **Access Control**: Middleware for API endpoint protection
- **User Management**: Invitation system and role assignment

## Starter Prompt for New AI Conversations

```
I'm implementing a sophisticated multi-tenant cocktail recipe management system in a MedusaJS 2.0 application.

**Project Context:**
- Building a cocktail recipe module inspired by Difford's Guide
- Multi-tenant architecture with clients, restaurants, and sophisticated RBAC
- Using DataTable patterns already established in the codebase
- 3-tier architecture: Core data + Structured relationships + Flexible metadata
- Focus on performance, maintainability, import capabilities, and access control

**Multi-Tenancy Requirements:**
- Platform team manages clients, roles, and platform recipes
- Clients can create custom recipes and ingredients for their restaurants
- Sophisticated role-based access control with platform-managed roles
- Shared database with logical access controls

**Established Patterns:**
- DataTable components with professional admin UI
- Server-side filtering/search with debounced frontend
- MikroORM models with proper relationships
- RESTful API design with query parameter support

**Request:**
- Please proceed with Task 2.3 as described below
  - This should be mostly an admin ui related task as the API should be in place
  - Create role management admin interface
  - Permission assignment interface for roles
  - Client-specific role scoping interface
  - User role assignment for platform admins
  - **User Testing**: Platform admins can manage roles and permissions

**Approach:**
- Please follow the existing code patterns in the restaurant and delivery modules
- Leverage the DataTable implementations for consistent UI/UX
- Provide the user instructions for verifying functionality at the established "User Testing" tasks
- *VERY IMPORTANT:* Stay focused on the core task

- **Role-Based Access**: Confirm permissions control feature access
- **Cross-Tenant Scenarios**: Test platform recipe distribution
- **Scale Testing**: Performance with multiple tenants and large datasets

### Manual Testing Points

- After each task: Feature-specific testing with different user roles
- After each phase: Cross-tenant integration testing
- Regular security testing throughout development
- Performance testing with realistic multi-tenant data volumes

### Automated Testing

- Unit tests for service layer methods with tenant context
- API endpoint testing with various permission levels
- Integration tests for complex multi-tenant workflows
- Performance benchmarks with tenant isolation

### User Acceptance Testing

- Platform admin workflows (manage clients, roles, recipes)
- Client admin workflows (manage users, create recipes)
- End-user workflows (access recipes based on permissions)
- System performance under multi-tenant load
